Data for surface water was downloaded from the [USGS Water Data For the Nation](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis) website for a site in Tennessee that had multiple measurements for at least a year.  The data is used here to simulate a year of readings from another source to try and identify treands and predict a randomly assigned variable.  The randomly assigned variable could represent a filter change, or maintenance which in the data is named `random`.  The random variable was assigned to remain 0 for 95% of the timespan of the data which ranged from `r min(wat_cumb$datetime)` to `r max(wat_cumb$datetime)`, and score a 1 or 2 for only 5% of the timespan.  

The variables measured at the USGS site #03434870 from the river station were:

+ Temperature (Celsius)   
`temp_c_av`
+ Specific Conductance (Ms per cm at 25C)  
`SpC_ms_av`
+ pH (Field)  
`pH_av`
+ Dissolved Oxygen (Mg/L)  
`DO_mgl_av`
+ Random (Simulating rare occurance event)  
`random`

## Data exploration
```{r plot_all, echo = F}
plot_dta <- wat_cumb %>% 
  select(datetime, temp_c_av, SpC_ms_av, pH_av, DO_mgl_av, random) %>% 
  gather("parameter", "value", -datetime) %>% 
  na.omit()

ggplot(plot_dta, aes(x = datetime, y = value, color = parameter)) +
  geom_point(size = .5) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = '4 months', date_labels = '%b-%Y')+
    theme_light() +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1, size = 8)) +
  facet_wrap(~parameter, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(title = "Exploratory analysis at the Cumberland River, TN",
       subtitle = "All Paramaters plotted through time",
       x = "")

```

The data is showing seasonal trends in alomst all of the measured paramaters which is to be expected.  There appears to be a strong seasonal trean in the temperature `temp_c_av`, but no seasonal trend in the random data.  A closer examination of the data shows a sine-like wave trend in the temperature that is well fitted.


```{r exploration, echo = F}
Time <- as.numeric(wat_cumb$datetime)
temp <- wat_cumb$temp_c_av

xc <- cos(2*pi*Time/366)
xs <- sin(2*pi*Time/366)
fit.lm <- lm(temp~xc+xs)
fit <- fitted(fit.lm)

pred <- predict(fit.lm, newdata = data.frame(Time=time))

plot(temp_c_av~as.numeric(datetime), data = wat_cumb,
     xlab = 'Time', ylab = "Temperature(C)", pch = 19, cex = .5)
lines(Time, pred, col="blue")
title(main = "Water Temperature Through Time at the Cumberland River, TN\nSinesoidal Predicted wave overlain")
```
```{r cumb_temp, eval = F, echo = F}
# ggplot(wat_cumb, aes(x = as.numeric(datetime), y = temp_c_av)) +
#   geom_point(color = 'grey40', size = .5)+
#   geom_line(color = 'blue', data = pred, aes(x=Time, y=as.numeric(datetime)))+
#   scale_x_date(date_breaks = '3 months', date_labels = '%b-%Y')+
#   labs(title = "Water Temperature (C) at USGS_03434870",
#        x = "", y = "Temperature C") +
#   theme_light()
```


To further explore the relationship between the data and their correlation to one antoher, a correlation plot with a histogram and significance overlays can be completed using the _Spearman_ correlation coefficent to identify linear and non-linear trends.

```{r corr, echo = F}
plot_dta = wat_cumb %>% 
  mutate(date = as.numeric(as.POSIXct(wat_cumb$datetime, format = "%Y-%m-%d"))) %>% 
  select(date, temp_c_av, SpC_ms_av, pH_av, DO_mgl_av, random)
correlation <- cor(plot_dta, method = "spearman", use = "complete.obs")
chart.Correlation(plot_dta, histogram = T, pch = 19, method = 'spearman')
```


The plots indicate a strong relationship between Dissolved oxygen (DO) and temperature.
